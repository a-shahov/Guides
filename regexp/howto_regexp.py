# repeating things
# * is greedy in means that when repeating a RE, the matching engine
# will try to repeat it as many times as possible.
# If later portions of the pattern donâ€™t match, the matching engine will
# then back up and try again with fewer repetitions.
pattern = r'.*'  # matches any character zero or more times '{0,}'
pattern = r'ca*t'  # 'ct', 'cat', 'caaaaaat' - all correct matches
pattern = r'a[bcd]*b'  # greedy in action for 'abcbd'
pattern = r'.+'  # matches any character 1 or more times '{1,}'
pattern = r'ca+t'  # matches 'cat', 'caaat' not 'ct'
pattern = r'.?'  # mathces any character 1 or zero times '{0,1}'
pattern = r'.{m,n}'  # matches any character must be at least m repetitions and at most n
pattern = r'ca{1,3}t'  # matches 'cat', 'caat', 'caaat'
pattern = r'[ab]{2}'  # mathces 'aa', 'ab', 'ba', 'bb'
pattern = r'f{,4}'  # matches '', 'f', 'ff', 'ffff'
